PS – Sub playbook: ATP Delete Indicators 

**Playbook Description:** This sub playbook receives the selected indicator for deletion. The playbook will then validate that the indicator currently exists in Microsoft ATP.

If the indicator does exist, the playbook will execute the delete indicator script. If any errors occur in this step, the playbook will follow the error path and print a statement for the analyst. The playbook will then delete context for that sub playbook.
